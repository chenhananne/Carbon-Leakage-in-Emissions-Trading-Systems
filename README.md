The findings of this project is built by Han Chen, Monica Di Gregorio, Jouni Paavola. 

We provide meta-analysis of ex-ante and ex-post studies on carbon leakage in Emissions Trading Systems. We sperately conducted the data abstraction for ex-ante and ex-post studies. The data was documented in the DataAbstraction.xlsx. 

For meta-regression of ex-ante studies, the data was documented in MetaRegression_ExAnte.xlsx

For meta-analysis of ex-post studies, the dota was documented in MetaAnalysis_ExPost.xls

The provided data was run by Stata. All results were documented in MetaAnalysis_Ante.dta and Kernel Density Estimate.dta for ex-ante studies. 
The results of ex-post studies were documented in MetaAnalysis_ExPost_CarbonTransfer.dta, MetaAnalysis_ExPost_Trade.dta, MetaAnalysis_ExPost_ElectricityTrade.dta, and MetaAnalysis_ExPost_Investment.dta.
