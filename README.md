Carbon Leakage in Emissions Trading Systems: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Ex-ante and Ex-post Evidence

This project's findings are built by Han Chen. 

We provide a meta-analysis of ex-ante and ex-post studies on carbon leakage in Emissions Trading Systems. We separately conducted the data abstraction for ex-ante and ex-post studies, documenting the data in DataAbstraction.xlsx. 

For meta-regression of ex-ante studies, the data were documented in MetaRegression_ExAnte.xlsx

For meta-analysis of ex-post studies, the data were documented in MetaAnalysis_ExPost.xls

Stata ran the provided data. All results were documented in MetaAnalysis_Ante.dta and Kernel Density Estimate.dta for ex-ante studies. 
The results of ex-post studies were documented in MetaAnalysis_ExPost_CarbonTransfer.dta, MetaAnalysis_ExPost_Trade.dta, MetaAnalysis_ExPost_ElectricityTrade.dta, and MetaAnalysis_ExPost_Investment.dta.
